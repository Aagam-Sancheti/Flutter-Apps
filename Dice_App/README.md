# ðŸŽ² Dicee â€“ Random Dice Roller

The Dicee app is the second step in my Flutter learning journey, building upon the basics learned in MiCard and introducing **interactivity and state management.**

This project is a simple dice-rolling application where **tapping a button generates random dice faces, simulating a real dice roll.** It demonstrates how to handle user interactions, manage widget states, and dynamically update the UI based on app logic.

Key Learnings:
	â€¢	Introduction to stateful widgets in Flutter
	â€¢	Managing app state with setState()
	â€¢	Generating random values using Dartâ€™s math library
	â€¢	Updating UI dynamically based on state changes
	â€¢	Enhancing user engagement with interactive elements

This project helped me move beyond static UIs, giving me hands-on experience with building dynamic, interactive apps â€” an essential step toward more complex application development.
