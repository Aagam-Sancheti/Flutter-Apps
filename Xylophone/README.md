The **Xylophone App** represents the **fourth step** in my Flutter learning journey, introducing **multimedia integration** into app development. This app allows users to play musical notes by tapping colorful keys, creating a simple yet engaging digital instrument.  

While visually minimal, it provided **hands-on experience with audio playback** and strengthened my understanding of **asset management** within a Flutter project.  

## Key Learnings
- Integrated **audio playback** using the `audioplayers` package  
- Managed and structured **Flutter assets** (sound files & UI elements)  
- Enhanced **gesture interaction handling** for responsive sound playback  
- Designed **colorful, clean UI layouts** using Flutterâ€™s widget tree  
- Gained insights into **building interactive, media-rich applications**  

This project showcased how **multimedia can enhance user experiences**, adding another layer of interactivity to my growing Flutter skill set.
