The **Quizzler App** marks a **significant leap** in my Flutter learning journey, as it introduced the concept of **state management** and **dynamic UI updates**. This app provides a fun, interactive quiz experience where users answer true/false questions, and the UI reacts instantly to their responses.  

This project challenged me to think about **application state** and how to efficiently manage and update data-driven interfaces.

## Key Learnings
- Implemented **stateful widgets** to manage changing quiz data  
- Used **custom Dart classes** to structure question and answer logic  
- Designed a **dynamic UI** that updates based on user interactions  
- Practiced **clean code organization** by separating logic from UI components  
- Strengthened understanding of **control flow and conditional rendering** in Flutter  

The **Quizzler App** taught me how to build **data-driven, reactive interfaces**, a key skill for developing real-world interactive apps.
