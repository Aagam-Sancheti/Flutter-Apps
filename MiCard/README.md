MiCard – My Digital Business Card

This was one of the first apps built in my Flutter learning journey. MiCard is a simple yet elegant digital business card application designed using Flutter. It demonstrates the use of **basic Flutter widgets such as Column, Row, Card, ListTile, and CircleAvatar,** while focusing on layout structuring, custom styling, and widget composition.

This project marks the starting point of exploring cross-platform UI design in Flutter, laying the groundwork for building more interactive and feature-rich applications in subsequent projects.

Key Learnings:
	•	Structuring layouts with Column and Row
	•	Using Cards and ListTiles for information presentation
	•	Applying custom fonts, colors, and assets
	•	Building a clean and responsive UI
