The **Magic 8 Ball** app marks the **third milestone** in my Flutter learning path, expanding upon the interactivity concepts explored in the Dicee project.  

This fun and engaging app simulates the classic "Magic 8 Ball" toy â€” the user asks a question, taps the ball, and a **randomized answer** appears. While simple, it introduces **conditional logic** and strengthens understanding of **state management** in dynamic apps.  

## Key Learnings
- Deepened use of **stateful widgets** for managing dynamic UI  
- Implemented **randomized responses** using Dart's `math` library  
- Leveraged **gesture-based interactions** (tap detection)  
- Improved **UI responsiveness** and feedback loop design  
- Reinforced concepts of **rebuilding widgets** upon state change  

This project emphasized **combining interactivity with logic**, laying a strong foundation for developing **apps with dynamic decision-making and richer user experiences**.
